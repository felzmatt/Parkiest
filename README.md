# Parkest

Parkest is a parking-optimization web application designed to help users find the best parking spot near their chosen destination. The app automatically:

- Guides the user to select a destination via Google Maps Autocomplete.
- Finds nearby parking spots using the backend's geospatial search.
- Estimates expected search times for every parking spot.
- Shows the total trip duration (driving + walking + search time).
- Highlights how much time each parking spot saves compared to others.
- Displays driving and walking routes using Google Maps Directions.
- Allows the user to start navigation in Google Maps.

The goal is to simulate what users do mentally when searching for parking: compare multiple possibilities and pick the optimal one. Parkest makes this automatic, visual, and data-driven.

## Features

- **Google Maps Search** – Autocomplete-based destination input.
- **Parking Discovery** – Finds parking spots within a given radius.
- **Search Time Estimation** – Estimates how long it takes to find parking.
- **Route Visualization** – Driving route to the selected parking + walking route to the final destination.
- **Bottom Sheet (Mobile)** – Details about the selected parking spot: address, estimated search time, total travel time, and time saved compared to other spots.
- **Start Navigation** – Opens Google Maps navigation to the chosen parking spot.

## How to Run

### 1. Start the Backend
From the project **root directory**, run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will build and start the API service that:
- Returns nearby parking spots
- Computes search time estimates
- Supports trip history tracking

### 2. Start the Frontend
Navigate to the **frontend directory**:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install dependencies (first time only):

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173).

## Environment Variables
Make sure the frontend has valid values in `.env` or similar Vite config:

```
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_key_here
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## Folder Structure (Simplified)

```

## Summary
Parkest speeds up the parking process by:
- Giving users visibility into all nearby parking options
- Estimating search effort
- Computing full trip times
- Showing which spot is truly the fastest option

It reduces guesswork, saves time, and simplifies decision-making for drivers navigating busy urban areas.
